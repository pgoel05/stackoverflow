## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

This code will easily run with the default anaconda packaged libraries. Still, I am mentioning the important modules below:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Sklearn
- Maplotlib
- Collections
- Seaborn

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This project came as a part of [Data Scientist Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025) offered by Udacity.

After perusing the Stack Overflowâ€™s developer survey dataset,  I got curious to know about the following things:
1. What methods are being suggested to help people dive into this field?
2. What are the salary trends?
3. What mode of formal education plays a vital role?
4. Did bootcamp have any impact on developer's career?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

Here I have kept 2 python notebooks:
1. DiveIntoTheField - To answer first 4 questions (EDA)
2. Salary_Prediction - To predict salary based on given features

## Model Optimization <a name="optimization"></a>

Optimization approach I followed is described in the post [here](https://goelprateek.medium.com/is-my-model-optimised-f1cf2fec8527).

## Licensing <a name="licensing"></a>

Feel free to use the above code as you would like!
